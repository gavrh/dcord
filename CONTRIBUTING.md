### Unsafe

Code that defines or uses `unsafe` functions must be reasoned with comments.
`unsafe` code can pose a potential for undefined behaviour related bugs and other
kinds of bugs to sprout if misused, weakening security. If you commit code containing
`unsafe`, you should confirm that its usage is necessary and correct.
